DENARIUS
--------

Denarius (mas. s.) aims to be the currency of the Oppidum for Hellenic Hospitality and the Roman organisations (Nova Roma, Roman Republic and Byzantium Novum).

The Denarius will operate on a proof of work algorithm and will use a proprietary blockchain to store data about transactions and the amount of money in the system. The blockchain also ensures the legitimacy of the money being used by the people of the nation. Each block in the chain contains the identifier of the previous block meaning for the entire chain to be compromised over 50% of all blocks will need to be corrupted and each block can be restored. The blockchain proprietary protocol will also allow for quick and disruption-free transactions around the globe.
