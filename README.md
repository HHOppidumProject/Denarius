SOLIDUS
--------

Solidus (mas. s.) aims to be the currency of the Oppidum for Hellenic Hospitality and the Roman organisations (Nova Roma, Roman Republic and Byzantium Novum).

The Solidus will operate on a proof of work algorithm and will use a proprietary blockchain to store data about transactions and the amount of money in the system. The blockchain also ensures the legitimacy of the money being used by the people of the nation. Each block in the chain contains the identifier of the previous block meaning for the entire chain to be compromised over 50% of all blocks will need to be corrupted and each block can be restored. The blockchain proprietary protocol will also allow for quick and disruption-free transactions around the globe.

Proposed Subdivisioning
---

I propose that the solidus should have several subdivisions, allowing for division by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. this means the lowest subdivision will be at a ratio of `1/2520`

My proposed currency would work as follows

|            | Solidi | Denarii | Sestertii | Folles | Nummi |
|------------|--------|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Solidus    | 1      | 14      | 56        | 280    | 2520  |
| Denarius   | 1/14   | 1       | 4         | 20     | 180   |
| Sestertius | 1/56   | 1/4     | 1         | 5      | 45    |
| Follis     | 1/280  | 1/20    | 1/5       | 1      | 9     |
| Nummus     | 1/2520 | 1/180   | 1/45      | 1/9    | 1     |

In text there would be:
* 14 Denarii in a Solidus
* 4 Sestertii in a Denarius
* 5 Folles in a Sestertii
* 9 Nummi in a Folles

Each of these have been chosen for good reason:
* The Solidus was chosen due to being the primary coin of the Byzantine Empire and was chosen by popular vote over the Denarius
* The Denarius was chosen due to being the primary coin of the Roman Republic for many years and lends its name to the word for money in many languages
* The Sestertius was chosen as it was the coin that was the subdivision for denarii
* The Follis was chosen due to it being a popular coin in both the Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire. In addition to this it makes up the largest category of coin finds in the province of Britannia
* The Nummus was chosen as it was the lowest value coin in the Byzantine Empire.
